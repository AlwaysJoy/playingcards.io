<h2 id="hand-and-foot-rules">Hand and Foot Rules</h2>
<!-- Objective -->

<ul>
<li>The goal of Hand and Foot is to empty your hand by forming table melds and to end up as the highest scoring team after four rounds.</li>
<li>Players start with a 13-card hand along with a face-down 13-card &quot;foot&quot; that is only used once the hand is emptied.</li>
<li>Points are distributed on a per-team-basis, so players must work together to build valuable melds and try to block their opponents from picking up cards they need.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="set-up">Set Up</h2>
<ol>
<li>Four players form two teams with partners sitting opposite each other. Teammates share a melding space on the table.</li>
<li>You will need one deck more than the number of players. So, for a game with four people you&#39;ll need five standard decks with two Jokers per pack, totaling 270 cards.</li>
<li>Choose which team will go first. That team will deal 13 cards to each player&#39;s hand and 13 face-down cards to each player&#39;s foot. Players may not look at their foot cards until they&#39;ve played all of the cards in their hand.</li>
<li>The remaining cards form the stock. Turn the top card of the stock over to start the discard pile. If that card is a red Three or a wild card, reshuffle it into the stock and turn over a different card.</li>
<li>Play proceeds clockwise from the dealer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Before taking their first turn of the game, each player must place any red Threes they hold face-up in their melding space, then draw the same number of cards from the stock. These are not counted as melds but will affect scores at the end of a hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On every turn, players begin by either drawing the top two cards from the stock or by taking the top seven cards from the discard pile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a player chooses to take the discard cards, they must meet these requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The top card of the discard pile cannot be a black Three.</li>
<li>Two cards in that player&#39;s hand must be of the same rank as the top card in the discard pile.</li>
<li>The player must be able to immediately meld those two cards with the third in the pile.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If drawing from the stock, or when satisfying the discard requirements above, players are then free to create melds or add to melds in their team&#39;s space. If a player empties their hand through melding, they immediately pick up their foot and continue creating/adding to melds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Melds are sets of three to seven cards of the same rank (suit doesn&#39;t matter). Before playing their first meld of a round, teams must be able to meet the minimum point requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Round 1: 50 points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Round 2: 90 points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Round 3: 120 points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Round 4: 150 points</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cards are scored based on the following point values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jokers: 50 points each</li>
<li>Aces and 2: 20 points each</li>
<li>8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King: 10 points each</li>
<li>4, 5, 6, 7: 5 points each</li>
<li>Black 3: 5 points each</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Twos and Jokers are wild. They may be used to represent any card in a meld, provided the meld has at least twice as many non-wild cards as wild. (In practice, this means only melds of six or seven cards can have two wilds.) A meld may also be composed exclusively of wild cards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a meld reaches its maximum of seven cards, place it in the &quot;Completed Melds&quot; container. These are referred to as piles. If the pile is clean, make sure a red card is on top. If it&#39;s dirty, show a black card, and if it&#39;s wild, show a Two or Joker.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean meld: All cards of the same rank with no wilds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dirty meld: A meld with one or two wild cards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wild meld: A meld composed of nothing but wild cards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Discard a card to the top of the pile to end your turn. If doing this empties your hand, pick up your foot and use it on your next turn.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taking-a-turn">Taking a Turn</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place red Threes from your hand onto the side of your table and draw a replacement card.</li>
<li>Either draw two cards from the stock or take the top seven cards from the discard pile.</li>
<li>Create or add to existing melds on your team&#39;s table using cards in your hand.</li>
<li>Discard a card to end your turn.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="winning--scoring">Winning &amp; Scoring</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>To win the game, one member of a team must completely empty their hand and their foot. Their partner must also have played at least one turn from their foot and given their teammate permission to go out.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team attempting to declare victory must have at least two dirty piles, two clean piles, and one wild pile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the above conditions are met, the winning team will meld all of their remaining cards before tallying the score.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both teams receive points for melds on their side of the table. Use the scoring chart as above to tally these results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Teams lose points for cards they still hold in their hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bonus points are given to both teams based on the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each complete wild pile: 1,500 points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each complete clean pile: 500 points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each complete dirty pile: 300 points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Going out bonus: 100 points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each red Three on their side of the table: 100 points</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Another way of ending the hand is if the stock is depleted. If this happens, simply add points to each team&#39;s total based on their table melds, and subtract based on the cards left in their hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once points are tallied, add the totals to each team&#39;s score counter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reshuffle all cards back into the deck. The person to the original dealer&#39;s left will deal new hands and feet and the second round will begin.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The game ends after four rounds. Whichever team has the highest score at that point wins.</p>
</li>
