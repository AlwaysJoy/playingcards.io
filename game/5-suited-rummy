<p>The game has a lot in common with the rummy variant known as Three Thirteen (3-13). Also compare to Five Crowns™ card game by Cannei, LLC.</p>
<h2 id="5-suited-rummy-rules">5 Suited Rummy Rules</h2>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal of 5 Suited Rummy is to be the player with the lowest score at the end of 11 hands.</li>
<li>In each round, players try to form runs and sets from all the cards in their hand. Only when they successfully do so will they place melds on the table.</li>
<li>Cards a player cannot discard by the end of the round add to their score. The lowest point total at the end of 11 rounds wins the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-up">Set Up</h3>
<ol>
<li>5 Suited Rummy is played with one deck of 58 cards with 11 card values (3-10, Jack, Queen, King) spread across five suits (stars, hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). Each deck also contains three Jokers.</li>
<li>The game is ideal for 2-4 players, though 5 Suited Rummy can be played with up to seven people. Add one deck for each pair of players beyond the first.</li>
<li>Choose a dealer and shuffle the deck. Deal each player three cards for the first round. Add one card to the deal for each subsequent round (round two = four cards, round three = five, etc.)</li>
<li>Place the remainder of the cards in the center of the table.</li>
<li>Turn over the top card and set it next to the stock to form the discard pile.</li>
<li>The player to the dealer&#39;s left goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h3>
<ol>
<li>Begin the turn by drawing the top card from the stock or taking the top discard card.</li>
<li>Hands are arranged in sets or runs. A set is three or more cards of the same value, regardless of suit, while a run is three or more cards of the same suit in a numerical sequence (such as 9, 10, Jack of hearts).</li>
<li>Jokers are always wild. Each round also has an additional wild card that corresponds to the number of cards dealt that round. In round one, for example, players are dealt three cards and threes are wild. This goes up to round 11 where players receive 13 cards and Kings are wild. Use the chooser below the discard pile to keep track of which cards are wild in each round.</li>
<li>The active player tries to form their hand into valid sets and runs, leaving only a single card to discard at the end of the turn. If a player cannot empty their hand, they simply discard a card and their turn ends.</li>
<li>When a player does empty their hand (called &quot;going out&quot;), the other players take one final turn before the round ends. They will take their turn as normal, then lay down any valid sets and runs they hold but keep the remaining cards in their hand.</li>
<li>Until a player goes out, each person continues taking their turns until someone is able to empty their hand.</li>
<li>When a round ends, players calculate their scores (see the section below), then reshuffle the deck and begin a new round.</li>
<li>Each subsequent round increases the number of cards dealt by one. In the first round, all players get three cards, in the second they receive four, and so on, all the way to 11.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="taking-a-turn">Taking a Turn</h3>
<ol>
<li>Players may draw a single card from the stock or the top card from the discard pile.</li>
<li>If the player can form their entire hand into valid sets and runs, minus one card to discard, they will do so. The other players then take one last turn before the round ends.</li>
<li>If the player cannot form their hand into valid sets or runs, they simply discard a card and their turn ends.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Any cards left in a player&#39;s hand after the final turn of the round are added to their score. Points are based on card values, shown on the chart below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-wild 3-10 - Face value</li>
<li>Jack - 11 points</li>
<li>Queen - 12 points</li>
<li>King - 13 points</li>
<li>Current round&#39;s wild card: 20 points</li>
<li>Joker - 50 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Points accumulate between rounds. The player with the lowest score after all 11 rounds is declared the winner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
