Indian Rummy is a hand management game for 2-6 players. Also known as Paplu.</p>
<h2 id="indian-rummy-rules">Indian Rummy Rules</h2>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Indian Rummy, the ultimate objective is to score the most points after all players have had a turn as dealer.</li>
<li>The objective each round is to &quot;go rummy&quot; with cards by forming &quot;sets&quot; and &quot;runs&quot; within your hand. A set is a group of 3 or more cards containing cards of same rank, different suit (EXAMPLE: A set might include a 4 Hearts, 4 Clubs and a 4 Diamonds). A run is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards in the same suit (EXAMPLE: A run might include a 6 Hearts, Joker, 8 Hearts - In this example, a wild Joker is being used in lieu of a 7 Hearts). A set cannot contain cards of the same rank and suit, only same rank different suit.</li>
<li>A player &quot;goes rummy&quot; and ends the round when their entire 13 card hand includes sets and runs. However, a player can only go rummy if their hand contains at least one natural run (a run containing no wilds) as well as a second run, natural or not. The remaining cards can be runs or sets, natural or not.</li>
<li>Only the player who goes rummy each round will score points.</li>
<li>*These rules do not include the rules for &quot;packing&quot; as packing is generally only used for games of Indian Rummy involving money.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-up">Set-up</h3>
<ol>
<li>Rummy uses 2 standard 52 card decks + 2 jokers. Shuffle all cards together and flip over the top card of the deck. This card will determine the wild card for the round (EXAMPLE: If the card discard is a 9 of Hearts, all 9s of any suit for the round are wild). Jokers are always wild in addition to the round&#39;s wild card.</li>
<li>Place the wild card beneath the deck sideways and face up to indicate that it is the wild card (it will not be in play for the round). *For PlayingCards.io, there is a card holder next to the deck for the round&#39;s wild card.</li>
<li>The dealer deals each player 13 cards.</li>
<li>The top card of the deck is flipped over to start the discard pile.</li>
<li>Players organize their hands to better prepare for sets and runs.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Cards are ranked high to low as normal: A &gt; 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Starting with the player left of the dealer, each player will take a turn in clockwise order.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On a player&#39;s turn, they must either draw from the top of the deck or the top of the discard pile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After a player draws, they then must discard a card from their hand (this may be the card the player had just drawn). Play proceeds clockwise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the draw deck ever runs out, leave the top card of the discard pile and shuffle the rest of the discard pile to form a new draw deck (leave the wild card at the bottom where it is).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The round ends when a player goes rummy (their entire hand includes sets and runs). Remember that a player can only go rummy if their hand contains at least one natural run (a run containing no wilds) as well as a second run, natural or not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a player goes rummy, they announce &quot;rummy!&quot;, discard their card per usual and lay down their hand to show the other players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The round ends and score is calculated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When starting a new round, the dealer is the player left of the previous round&#39;s dealer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<ul>
<li>After each round, points are awarded only to the player who went rummy.</li>
<li>The player who went rummy scores points for each card remaining in all other players&#39; hands.</li>
<li>Cards remaining in other players hands have the following point values: 2-9 = Face Value (EXAMPLE: 5 of Hearts is worth 5 points) 10/J/K/Q are each worth 10 points, Aces are worth 11 and wilds are worth 0.</li>
<li>If a player has a natural run, those cards are removed and the player who went rummy gets points for all other cards in their hand.</li>
<li>If a player has a natural run and a second run, those cards as well as any other cards that are part of a set or a run are removed and only remaining cards in their hand are scored.</li>
<li>Players keep tally of their scores from round to round.</li>
<li>*To save on table space in PlayingCards.io, score and discard each non-winning player&#39;s hand one at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="winning">Winning</h2>
<p>After all players have had a turn to be dealer, the winner is the player with the most points.</p>
