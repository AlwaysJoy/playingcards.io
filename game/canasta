<h2 id="canasta-rules">Canasta Rules</h2>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Canasta, the goal is to be the first team to score 5000 points via their card melds (sets of cards). Cards are scored according to their rank and quantity.</li>
<li>To start a meld, a player must have at least three or more matching rank cards (EXAMPLE: P1 starts a meld by placing down three 9&#39;s).</li>
<li>2&#39;s and Jokers are wild cards and may used to help start a meld or be added to an existing meld. However, a meld can never have more wild cards than cards of the actual rank (EXAMPLE: P1 can add Jokers and 2&#39;s to their meld of three 9&#39;s, but they cannot add any more than three Jokers and 2&#39;s because they only have three non-wild cards in the meld).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-up">Set-up</h3>
<ol>
<li>Canasta uses two standard card decks + 4 jokers.</li>
<li>Players divide themselves into two teams and sit so that they are opposite of their teammate (EXAMPLE: Team 1 - Player 1, Team 2 - Player 2, Team 1 - Player 3, Team 2 - Player 4).</li>
<li>The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 11 cards 1 card at a time.</li>
<li>The remaining deck is placed in the middle and the top card is discarded to start the discard pile. If a red or black 3 is discarded, another card is discarded on top. If a wild card is discarded, it is placed sideways so that it sticks out horizontally from the discard pile and another card is discarded on top. *For PlayingCards.io, simply offset the wild card so that it is poking out of the discard pile.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The player left of the dealer starts the round.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The structure of a turn in Canasta is: draw, play cards, discard.</p>
<p><strong>Draw</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before a player draws, they must play each red 3 from their hand and replace them with cards drawn from the deck. Any red 3&#39;s that are ever drawn are immediately played into a new or existing meld and the card is replaced with one from the deck.</li>
<li>On their turn, a player may draw the card from the top of the discard pile if they are able to add the card to one of their team&#39;s melds or if they can use the card to create a new meld. If they cannot/do not want to do either, they must draw their card from the top of the deck instead.</li>
<li>When a player is able to draw from the discard pile, they add the entire discard pile to their hand (but they must be able to use the top card to create a meld or add to a meld).</li>
<li>If the top card of the discard pile is a black 3, the discard pile is blocked from drawing from and the player must draw from the deck.</li>
<li>If there is a wild card in the discard pile (sticking out horizontally), a player may only draw from the discard pile if they can make a natural meld using the top card (no wilds).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>After drawing from either the discard pile or deck, a player may start new melds (three or more cards of the same rank) from their hand or add to existing melds shared with their teammate. Remember that 2&#39;s and Jokers are wild but there can never be more wild cards than non-wild cards in a meld.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first meld each player starts each round must have a minimum value depending on their team&#39;s current score (red 3&#39;s do not count as melds as they are played automatically). The minimum first meld values are as follows:</p>
<p>0-1499: 50</p>
<p>1500-2999: 90</p>
<p>3000+: 120</p>
</li>
<li><p>Black 3&#39;s may only be melded if a player is &quot;going out&quot; at the end of their turn (see below).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discard</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After playing melds or adding to their team&#39;s melds, a player must discard 1 card from their hand.</li>
<li>If a wild card is discarded, it is discarded horizontally from the discard pile to signal that the discard pile is &quot;frozen&quot;. A player may now only draw from the discard pile if they can make a natural meld (no wilds) using the top card of the discard pile.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Going Out</strong></p>
<p>A round ends when one player &quot;goes out&quot;, meaning they end their turn with no cards in hand. A player may only go out if their team has at least one Canasta (meld of 7+ cards) among their melds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Canasta has several areas where teams can earn points. Points are earned from card values among a team&#39;s melds, from Canastas, red 3&#39;s and from going out to end a round.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Card Values (each card in a meld has the following value):</p>
<p>Aces: 20</p>
<p>8, 9, 10, J, Q, K: 10</p>
<p>4, 5, 6, 7: 5</p>
<p>2: 20</p>
<p>Joker: 50</p>
<p>Black 3: 5</p>
</li>
<li><p>When scoring melds, a team adds each of their meld&#39;s card values and then subtracts the values from any cards left in their hands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Canastas are melds of 7+ cards and on top of their individual card values, they score an additional 500 points if they are no wilds and 300 points if wilds were used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each red 3 a team has is worth 100 points and if a team has all four red 3&#39;s, they are worth 800 points.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team whose player went out to end the round scores an additional 100 points that round.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Score is kept round to round and each round teams will score for: Values from melds - values from cards in hand, Canasta bonuses, red 3&#39;s and going out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="winning">Winning</h2>
<p>The first team to 5000 or more points wins the game!</p>
