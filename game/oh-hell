The rules are fairly simple, but because there&#39;s an element of prediction and bidding, games can take wild turns between rounds.</p>
<p>Oh Hell! is also known as Oh Well!, Blob, Blackout, and Up and Down the River.</p>
<h2 id="oh-hell-rules">Oh Hell! Rules</h2>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal of Oh Hell! is for a player to estimate how many tricks they&#39;ll take with each hand, then try to win precisely that number of tricks.</li>
<li>Players can employ a surprising amount of strategy in each trick round by listening to other bids and purposefully laying down cards that cause other players to lose.</li>
<li>Huge points bonuses are awarded to players who accurately predict their number of winning tricks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-up">Set Up</h3>
<ol>
<li>Oh Hell! is played with one deck of 52 standard cards (no Jokers). Anywhere between 3-7 players may play, though 4-6 players are recommended.</li>
<li>Choose a dealer and shuffle the deck. The size of the first hand depends on the number of players in the game:<ol>
<li>3, 4, or 5 players: 10 cards in the first hand</li>
<li>6 players: 8 cards in the first hand</li>
<li>7 players: 7 cards in the first hand</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Turn over the top card of the stock. This card&#39;s suit becomes the trump suit for the hand. Trump suits beat any of the other suits, regardless of their rank.</li>
<li>Starting with the next number player and proceeding in a sequence, each person places a bid. Bids are a prediction as to how many tricks that player thinks they can take in the round. Players must make a bid, even if that bid is zero.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h3>
<ol>
<li>The first person who bid begins by placing a card into the center of the table. It may be any suit, including the trump suit. The first card placed in any trick is called the lead card.</li>
<li>The next player then places a card. If they can, they must place a card of the same suit as the lead card. If they cannot, any suit will suffice.</li>
<li>Once all players have played a card, the trick ends. The person who played the highest ranking card matching the lead card&#39;s suit wins the trick. If there is a trump suit, however, it beats any suit of any value. Higher ranked trump suits beat lower ranked trump suits.</li>
<li>The player who won the trick takes the cards and places them in their holder. They should also add one point to their &quot;Tricks Won&quot; counter.</li>
<li>The player who won the trick begins the next trick by laying down a new card from their hand. Play continues as normal from there.</li>
<li>Proceed in this manner until all player hands are empty.</li>
<li>After the last trick of the hand is taken, reshuffle the cards. The player who went next after the first dealer becomes the new dealer.</li>
<li>Deal one less card than the previous round, then place new bids and begin laying down cards as before.</li>
<li>In each round that follows, dealers will give out one less card than the previous round, all the way to the point where players will receive just one card in a deal. Then, for the next round, players will get one extra card in each starting hand, all the way up to the original amount (10 for most groups of players).</li>
<li>Games of Oh Hell! traditionally last as many hands as the above sequence will allow. So, if a game starts with 10 cards being dealt, players stay in the game until 10 cards are dealt again.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="taking-a-turn">Taking a Turn</h3>
<ol>
<li>The first player plays the lead card in a trick.</li>
<li>The following players must match that card&#39;s suit if possible. If they cannot, they may play any card in their hand.</li>
<li>When each player has played a card, the person who laid down the highest value card matching the lead card&#39;s suit (or a trump card) wins the trick.</li>
<li>The next trick plays out as above until all player hands are emptied.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>
<ol>
<li>When a hand ends, give each player one point for each trick they took.</li>
<li>If a player took exactly as many tricks as their bid, they gain 10 extra points.</li>
<li>At the end of all of the rounds, the player with the highest score is declared the winner.</li>
<li>There are many scoring variations for Oh Hell! Feel free to explore and experiment on your own!</li>
